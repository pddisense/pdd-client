# pdd-client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pddisense/pdd-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pddisense/pdd-client)

This repository contains the code for the client to the PDD server, which is materialised as an extension for the Chrome browser.
The extension is written in Javascript ES6, transpiled with Babel.
The user interface is written with React.

## Build
To build the extension, you will need [Node â‰¥10.9.0](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

First clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:pddisense/pdd-client.git && cd pdd-client
```

Then build the extension:
```bash
./bin/release
```

An unpacked Chrome extension will be generated in the `dist/chrome` directory.
You can then load it in your browser by going to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), toggling the "Developer mode" switch and then clicking on the "Load unpacked" button.
Then point to the content of the `dist/chrome` directory.
